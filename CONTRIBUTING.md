|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `feat(optional):`     | A new feature                                       |
| `fix(optional):`      | A bug fix                                           |
| `docs(optional):`     | Documentation related changes                       |
| `style(optional):`    | Everything related to styling                       |
| `refactor(optional):` | A code that neither fix bug nor adds a feature      |
| `test(optional):`     | Everything related to testing                       |
| `chore(optional):`    | Updating build tasks, package manager, configs, etc |

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
- Reference [Issues][issue-list] and [Pull Requests][pull-request-list] liberally after the first line.

Use this to start the message. Like if we added test for a function which checks leap year, we start with `test`. Then in short describe the work we did :point_down:

```bash
$ git commit -m "test: add unit test for leapYearCheck()"
```
